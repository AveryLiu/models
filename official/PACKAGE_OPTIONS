Summary:
    As the official models become more mature, it is useful to create utility code that can be
  shared between multiple models. What is unusual is that a very common use pattern if to run code
  from within the "package" without ever formally installing it. For instance:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
    $ cd models/official/resnet
    $ python cifar10_main.py -h

  Python doesn't really have a great way to import from within one's own package automagically.

Possible Solutions:
  Solution 0:
    Make people add the directory to their PYTHONPATH, and provide some instructions in the README.

  Solution 1:
    Put a bit of code before the model imports to make sure sys.path has the necessary value.

  Solution 2:
    Have a python script to handle path mangling, and symlink and import everywhere.
